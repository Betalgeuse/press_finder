-Aquisition information often leads to outside articles
Considered as a stable version Upper aim has transferred on press_finder_v2

-Aquisition information is held prior than the homepage's landing page.
Complex consdieration process is needed what prior must be held upon various circumstances.
When should the macro should give landing page and when should it give aquisition info?
maybe it is influenced by the num value. current numvalue of v 1.0 is num=5
